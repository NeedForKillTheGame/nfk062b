------------------------
Changes since NFK version 040.
Changes in NFK050 are mostly affecting network gaming and all regarding it

- New, greatly improoved and optimized network code. Protocol also changed. Nfk uses UDP now.. (port 29991).
- Online NFK Master Server was added, which named "NFK PLANET". It is a place where nfk players can play with each other.

- Added: if nfk server is in fullscreen mode, and minimized, then somebody connects, nfk popup it self.
- Added: command "sv_maxplayers", for limiting maximum amount of players.
- Added: command "ipinvite". invites specified ip address to your server. Useful then connection is available only to one direction
- Added: command "net_showbandwidth". shows channel current bandwidth, bytes/sec (network).
- Added: command "minimize". minimizes nfk window

- Added: VOTING. You can toggle voting for some console command, and if number of positive (YES) votes will be enough to apply this command, it will be executed at server.
	You can vote for: restart, ready, map, fraglimit, timelimit, capturelimit, domlimit, warmup,warmuparmor, forcerespawn, sync, sv_teamdamage, net_predict, sv_maxplayers.
	Example: "callvote restart", "callvote map tourney4".
	Server's voting console commands: sv_allowvote, sv_vote_percent, sv_allowvote_restart, sv_allowvote_fraglimit, sv_allowvote_timelimit, sv_allowvote_capturelimit, sv_allowvote_domlimit, sv_allowvote_ready,
